# Meadow-Simulator
This project, developed for the Foundations of Programming course, simulates an ecosystem in a meadow where animals coexist, move, feed, reproduce, and die. 

The simulation is built using abstract data types and includes a set of functions to manage and manipulate the necessary information throughout the simulation.

Hope you enjoy it!
